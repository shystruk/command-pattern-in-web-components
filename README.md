# Custom Elements with GitHub Jobs API (express and cors)

> With Custom Elements, web developers can create new HTML tags, beef-up existing HTML tags, or extend the components other developers have authored. The API is the foundation of web components. It brings a web standards-based way to create reusable components using nothing more than vanilla JS/HTML/CSS. The result is less code, modular code, and more reuse in our apps.

Run server from the root directory (localhost:80)
```
node index.js
```

Example usage:
```
<find-your-job></find-your-job>
```
